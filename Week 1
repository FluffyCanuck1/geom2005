This code will take two coordinates from the user inputs and will calculate the Euclidean distance and the Manhanttan distance between the two coordinates.
Code written by Matthew Osborne and Dipto Sarkar.

# Euclidean distance is the simplest distance between two points

# Manhattan distance is the distance between two points scrictly on a horizontal and vertical space
m_dist = math.abs(diff_x) + math.abs(diff_y)
print("The Manhattan distance is ", m_dist)

This set of code is used for taking coodinates in terms of decimal degrees and and will calculate the Great Circle distance
Code written by Matthew Osborne

import math
# Only one defined variable, r, which is the radius of the Earth.
float r = 6371.009
# Take the input from the user
print(Enter two sets of coordinates)

b1 = float(input("Enter b1: "))
a2 = float(input("Enter a2: "))
b2 = float(input("Enter b2: "))
# Delta a of a will be used for delta c

# Delta c is does the heavy lifting in the Great Cirlce equation
del_c = math.acos((math.sin(b1)*math.sin(b2))+(math.cos(b1)*math.cos(b2)*del_a))
# The Great Circle distance is the shortest distance from two points on a globe
