    "# Practice Program 2.2 - Flattening Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "For our very first practice program we are going to write a little script to calculate Earth's polar flattening. As you likely know, Earth more closely resembles an  oblate ellipsoid than a sphere. Due to Earth's rotation, its semimajor axis (equator to equator, through the center of Earth's mass) is larger than its semiminor axis (pole to pole, through the center of Earth's mass). See this Esri help page for more info and diagrams: [Spheroids and spheres](http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=Spheroids_and_spheres). To calculate the amount of flattening of an ellipsoid we can use the following simple formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$f=\\frac{(a-b)}{a}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f$ is the amount of flattening\n",
    "- $a$ is the length of the semimajor axis. \n",
    "- $b$ is the length of the semiminor axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because $f$ can be a very small number the flattening is usually reported as it's reciprocal $1/f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [WGS84 ellipsoid defines](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/about-the-geoid-ellipsoid-spheroid-and-datum-and-h.htm) Earth's semimajor axis as 6378137.0 meters and the its semiminor axis as 6356752.31424518 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For this practice program please create a simple Python script that will:\n",
    "- Ask the user to input the semimajor axis and assign its value to a variable\n",
    "- Ask the user to input the semiminor axis and assign its value to a variable\n",
    "- Use the formula above to calculate the flattening\n",
    "- Print the reciprocal of the flattening\n",
    "\n",

    "### Tips / Notes:\n",
    "- To include a user's input in your script you can use the `input()` function. \n",
    "    - You will need to assign the result of the input to a varialble: `x = input()`\n",
    "    - If you put some text within the parentheses that text will be printed as a prompt to the user:\n",
    "        - Example: `x = input(\"Enter a value\")`\n",
    "    - Anything passed by a user to the `input()` function will end up with the string data type. This means we have to convert any input values to an integer (whole number) or a floating point number (decimal number) if we want to perform any calculations with them. Integers are referred to by the `int` type, floating point numbers are referred to by the `float` type, and strings of characters and digits are referred to by the `str` type. Python has build-in functions to convert from one type to another but only valid values can be converted (e.g. you cannot convert `\"1.5g\"` from a string to a float due to the `\"g\"` character but `\"1.5\"` is fine.\n",
    "        - Type conversion functions:\n",
    "            - Convert `x` to a float: `x = float(x)`\n",
    "            - Convert `x` to an integer: `x = int(x)`\n",
    "            - Convert `x` to an string: `x = str(x)`\n",
    "        - Alternatively, wrap the `input()` function in one of those conversion functions to do it in one step:\n",
    "            - Example: `x = float(input(\"The input will become a float stored in x\"))`\n",
    "            - This is an example of nested brackets. Since 2 brackets were opened, both need to be closed.\n",
    "        - This sounds really complex but you'll figure it out quick. \n",
    "- You can print different data types together by separating them with a comma within the `print()` statement\n",
    "    - Example: `print(\"Number of dogs:\", 7)` will output `Number of dogs: 7`. Note: The comma adds a space between the two elements."

    "- Decimal degrees sometimes have a negative sign in front of them to indicate locations in the Southern and Eastern hemispheres. You'll need to remove that negative sign or all the degrees/minutes/seconds will have negative signs. The absolute value function `abs()` is a great way to do this.\n",
